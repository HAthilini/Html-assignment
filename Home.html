<p align="left"><font color="blue">Tourism is one of the major source of foreign exchange. Tourism is not merely a business for providing pleasure and rest. It has now grown into a big industry. Every year thousands of foreigners come to India as a result of which we earn a lot of foreign exchange.</font></p>
<br><br>
<p>Tours and holidays are the necessities of modern busy life. Gone are our peaceful and leisurely ways of life. Instead we have now to lead a busy and hurried life. in our daily life, we have to work very hard while discharging our duties and responsibilities. We also have to respond to various calls coming from home and outside. After performing all these we feel very tired and find that all our strength and energy has drained out. If it continues for a long time we fall a prey to complex physical and mental illness. Now nothing can replenish our lost energy so quickly and comfortably as tourism. We realize that the benefits of tourism are much more than what we pay for it.</p></body>
